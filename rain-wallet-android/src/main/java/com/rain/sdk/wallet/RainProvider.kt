/**
 * The Rain wallet: a registrable [ProviderDescriptor] under which the SDK owns authentication,
 * wallet provisioning, sessions and key export, so a host integrates one product under Rain's
 * names and configures nothing but behaviour.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val wallet = RainProvider(application)
 *
 * wallet.awaitSessionRestore()
 * if (!wallet.hasActiveSession()) {
 *     wallet.sendLoginCode(RainWalletContact.Email("user@example.com"))
 *     wallet.confirmLoginCode(code) // sign-up or login, plus wallet provisioning
 *     // or: wallet.loginWithPasskey(activity)
 * }
 *
 * val rain = RainSdk.builder()
 *     .rpcEndpoints(mapOf(8453 to "https://…"))
 *     .register(wallet)
 *     .build()
 * val client = rain.provider(ProviderId.RAIN)
 * ```
 *
 * Send a one-time login code to the user's email or phone, confirm it (a first login signs the
 * user up and creates one wallet holding an Ethereum and a Solana account on a single seed; a
 * returning login finds the account), then register the provider and resolve
 * `rain.provider(ProviderId.RAIN)`. Resolving before a session is live fails with
 * `RainError.TokenExpired` (`RAIN_201`). With [RainWalletConfig.passkeyDomain] set, a passkey is
 * the other first login: [signUpWithPasskey] creates the account, [loginWithPasskey] returns to
 * it, [addPasskey] gives a code-created account a passkey too, and [sendContactVerificationCode]
 * gives a passkey-created account an email or phone to sign in with.
 *
 * The wallet backend's configuration is one-shot per app launch and the first authentication call
 * applies it, `passkeyDomain` included. A backend the app configured itself, or another provider
 * in this process configured with a different backend identity or passkey domain, makes every
 * authentication call throw `RainError.InvalidConfig`
 * (`RAIN_102`) until the app relaunches; a failed backend initialization makes them throw
 * `RainError.InternalError` (`RAIN_502`) until then.
 *
 * The Rain wallet shares its process-wide wallet backend with the SDK's bring-your-own adapter for
 * that backend, so `RainSdk.Builder.build()` refuses a registry that holds both; the module README
 * names the adapter. That check is best-effort: a second `RainSdk` instance, or a provider that is
 * never registered, can still collide, which the backend reports as `RainError.InvalidConfig` on
 * the first authentication call.
