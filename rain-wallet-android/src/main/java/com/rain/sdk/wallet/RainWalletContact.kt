 * method. A first login signs the user up under this contact; a later login finds the account by
 * email for [Email] and by phone number for [Phone]. The same person arriving through the other
 * channel is a new account. [RainProvider.sendLoginCode] and [RainProvider.sendContactVerificationCode]
 * canonicalize the value once (trim for an email; trim, separator removal and an E.164 check for a
 * phone number) and send that same string on confirm. `toString()` hides the value, which is
 * personal data.
