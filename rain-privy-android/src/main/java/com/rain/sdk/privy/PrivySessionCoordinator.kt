/**

 * dying session into a host-visible signal (the `onSessionExpired` hook plus [sessionStates]).
 *
 * Unlike the Turnkey coordinator there is no refresh machinery: the Privy SDK single-flights
 * its own session refresh internally before every wallet/indexer call, so an auth failure that
 * reaches Rain means Privy already tried and the session is truly dead. Terminal auth failures
 * surface as [RainError.TokenExpired] and fire the hook once per session death; the hook
 * re-arms when a live session is seen again. Only a session Privy refuses or has dropped is a
 * death: a call or a [refreshNow] that got no answer from the network leaves as
 * [RainError.NetworkError], with the session and the hook untouched.
