/**
 * Classifies Privy vendor exceptions into specific [RainError] cases at the adapter boundary:
 * - authentication failures (not logged in / invalid or expired JWT) map to [RainError.TokenExpired]
 * - user cancellation / rejection maps to [RainError.UserRejected]
 * - "insufficient funds / balance / lamports" node messages map to [RainError.InsufficientFunds]
 * - missing wallet / failed wallet creation maps to [RainError.WalletUnavailable]
 * - a request that got no answer from the network maps to [RainError.NetworkError] when the host
 *   may safely retry it, see [map]
 * - any other Privy exception maps to [RainError.ProviderError]
 *
 * The Privy Kotlin SDK carries no structured reason codes on its exceptions
 * ([AuthenticationException] / [EmbeddedWalletException] are message-only), so wallet and RPC
 * failures classify by message. Rejection and funds-shortfall prose goes through core's
 * [VendorErrorClassifier] so Privy is held to the same standard as every other vendor.
 *
 * Non-Privy exceptions return `null` from [mapOrNull] and keep bubbling raw inside the adapter.
 * [map], which [PrivySessionCoordinator] applies to everything that leaves the adapter, reads them
 * for a network failure and then by the shared prose rules, and floors at
 * [RainError.ProviderError], so a user rejection or funds shortfall in a node message still
 * classifies rather than hiding behind a generic error.

     * maps to [RainError.NetworkError], the code hosts read as "retry, nothing was signed or
     * broadcast"; anything else is read by the shared prose rules before flooring at
     * [RainError.ProviderError].
     *
     * [idempotent] says whether the call that failed can be repeated without a second effect: a
     * read or a session refresh can, a send cannot. On an idempotent call every transport failure
     * is a [RainError.NetworkError] ([isNetworkFailure]). On a send only a failure that provably
     * happened before the request left the device is ([neverReachedPrivy]): Privy signs and
     * broadcasts a send inside the one request that carried it, so a timeout or a reset after it
     * left may follow a broadcast, and a host that retried on `RAIN_301` would send twice. Those
     * stay [RainError.ProviderError], an unknown fate, and so does a send the HTTP client resent
     * after such a failure and then could not connect for.
