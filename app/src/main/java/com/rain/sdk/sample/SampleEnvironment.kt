 * SDK is not told which Rain environment the demo uses; it only checks that an Auth Pull config's
 * chains belong to the environment its kind names.
 *
 * Left on [SampleRainEnvironment.SANDBOX] deliberately. Production means mainnet: real USDC, real
 * gas, and an allowance a real card authorization can draw on.
