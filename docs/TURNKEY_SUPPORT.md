# Turnkey Support

Rain SDK for Android supports [Turnkey](https://turnkey.com) as a wallet provider, alongside the Portal MPC and Privy adapters. Turnkey ships as the `TurnkeyProvider` adapter in its own `rain-turnkey-android` module (package `com.rain.sdk.turnkey`). Authentication has two modes. **Bring-your-own** (public): the host app uses the official [Turnkey Kotlin SDK](https://docs.turnkey.com/sdks/kotlin/getting-started) to authenticate (passkeys, OAuth, OTP, auth proxy) and hands the live `TurnkeyContext` to Rain via `TurnkeyConfig(turnkey)`. **Managed** (internal API, `@InternalRainTurnkeyApi`): construct `TurnkeyConfig(application, organizationId, authProxyConfigId, passkeyDomain?)` and the SDK owns the one-time-code flow, email or SMS, and the passkey flows through Turnkey's auth proxy, with `sendLoginCode` / `confirmLoginCode`, `loginWithPasskey` / `signUpWithPasskey` / `addPasskey`, `sendContactVerificationCode` / `confirmContactVerification`, `logout` and `authState` on `TurnkeyProvider`, and Ethereum + Solana account provisioning on first login. It compiles only with the opt-in and ships to hosts as the Rain wallet provider, `RainProvider` in `rain-wallet-android`, which exposes the same flow under Rain's names; see [Managed mode](#managed-mode-internal-api) and [rain-wallet-android/README.md](../rain-wallet-android/README.md). In both modes the provider also exports the wallet's recovery phrase and private keys, decrypted on the device. See [Key export](#key-export).

## Requirements

- `minSdk = 28` (matches Turnkey's requirement).
- Managed mode: nothing to initialize — the SDK configures Turnkey itself; the passkey flows also need a relying-party domain, see [Passkeys](#passkeys). Bring-your-own mode: the Turnkey Kotlin SDK initialized in your `Application.onCreate()`, with the passkey/auth-proxy/OAuth/OTP flow completed by the host app.
- **JDK 24+** to run unit tests that touch Turnkey types (`com.turnkey:encoding:1.0.0`, pulled in by the Turnkey SDK, ships class-file major version 68 / Java 24). Production Android builds are unaffected — R8/D8 dexes Turnkey's bytecode regardless of host JVM version. The `TurnkeyWalletProviderTest` suite skips itself automatically on JDKs older than 24 via `Assume.assumeTrue`.

## Adding the dependency

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Pulls rain-core-android and the Turnkey artifacts transitively.
    implementation("io.github.spartan-quanhongtran:rain-turnkey-android:1.0.1")
}
```

An app that does not register Turnkey should not depend on this module: the Turnkey artifacts come with it, and nothing else in the SDK pulls them. Internally the module pulls in:

```
com.turnkey:sdk-kotlin:2.0.1
com.turnkey:http:2.1.0
com.turnkey:types:2.1.0
com.turnkey:crypto:1.0.1
com.turnkey:encoding:1.0.0
com.turnkey:passkey:1.0.3
com.turnkey:stamper:1.0.3
androidx.credentials:credentials:1.5.0
androidx.credentials:credentials-play-services-auth:1.5.0
```

The module declares `androidx.credentials:credentials` itself, because its error mapping names the Credential Manager exception types by class; the other `androidx.credentials` artifact is the runtime passkey provider and arrives through Turnkey's passkey package, which puts the same version of both on every consumer's runtime classpath. No consumer sees a version change.

## Two modes

| Mode | Who authenticates | Config | Auth surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bring-your-own** (public) | Your app, against Turnkey's Kotlin SDK | `TurnkeyConfig(turnkey = TurnkeyContext)` | None — the managed members (`sendLoginCode` / `confirmLoginCode`, the passkey and contact-attach methods, `logout`) throw `RainError.InvalidConfig`; `awaitSessionRestore` is a no-op, `hasActiveSession()` is `false` and `authState` is `Unauthenticated` |
| **Managed** (internal API, `@InternalRainTurnkeyApi`) | Rain SDK, through Turnkey's auth proxy | `TurnkeyConfig(application, organizationId, authProxyConfigId, passkeyDomain?)` | `TurnkeyProvider.sendLoginCode` (a `LoginContact.Email` or `LoginContact.Phone`) / `confirmLoginCode` / `loginWithPasskey` / `signUpWithPasskey` / `addPasskey` / `sendContactVerificationCode` / `confirmContactVerification` / `logout` / `authState` / `awaitSessionRestore` / `hasActiveSession` — compile only with the opt-in |

In both modes the hand-off is the same boundary: register the `TurnkeyProvider` with the `RainSdk` builder, then resolve `rain.provider(ProviderId.TURNKEY)`. Everything after that — `getWalletAddress()`, balances, sends, `withdrawCollateral()` — is identical. Key export (`exportRecoveryPhrase`, `exportPrivateKey`) works in both modes as well. See [Key export](#key-export).

## Bring-your-own mode (the public Turnkey integration)

If your app already drives Turnkey's Kotlin SDK — passkeys, OAuth, your own OTP UI — keep doing that and hand the authenticated context to Rain. Initialize Turnkey from your `Application.onCreate()`:

```kotlin
import com.rain.sdk.RainSdk
import com.turnkey.core.TurnkeyContext
import com.turnkey.core.models.TurnkeyConfig  // NOTE: Turnkey's config, not Rain's TurnkeyConfig
import com.turnkey.core.models.AuthConfig

class MyApp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        // 1) Initialize Turnkey first (host-app responsibility).
        //    For OTP and auth-proxy flows, only organizationId + authProxyConfigId are required:
        TurnkeyContext.init(
            app = this,
            config = TurnkeyConfig(
                organizationId = "<your-parent-organization-id>",
                authProxyConfigId = "<your-auth-proxy-config-id>"
            )
        )

        // For passkey / OAuth flows you must also supply an AuthConfig with the relying-party id
        // (passkeys) and/or appScheme (OAuth deep-links):
        //
        // TurnkeyContext.init(
        //     app = this,
        //     config = TurnkeyConfig(
        //         organizationId = "<your-parent-organization-id>",
        //         authProxyConfigId = "<your-auth-proxy-config-id>",
        //         authConfig = AuthConfig(rpId = "<your-rp-id>"),
        //         appScheme = "<your-app-scheme>"
        //     )
        // )

        // Prefer `TurnkeyContext.initSuspend(app, cfg)` inside a coroutine if you need to await
        // session restoration before driving auth.

        // 2) Drive your auth flow (passkey / OTP / OAuth) somewhere in the app.
    }
}
```

Once the user is authenticated and `TurnkeyContext.session` is populated, hand it to Rain by
registering a `TurnkeyProvider`:

```kotlin
import com.rain.sdk.RainSdk
import com.rain.sdk.provider.ProviderId
import com.rain.sdk.turnkey.TurnkeyConfig
import com.rain.sdk.turnkey.TurnkeyProvider

val rain = RainSdk.builder()
    .rpcEndpoints(
        mapOf(
            8453 to "https://mainnet.base.org",
            84532 to "https://sepolia.base.org"
        )
    )
    .register(
        TurnkeyProvider(
            TurnkeyConfig(
                turnkey = TurnkeyContext,
                walletAddress = null // omit to use the first Ethereum account from TurnkeyContext.wallets
                // sponsorGas defaults to true: sends are gas-sponsored, which needs sponsorship enabled
                // on the Turnkey organization. Pass sponsorGas = false to have users pay their own gas.
            )
        )
    )
    .build()

val client = rain.provider(ProviderId.TURNKEY)
```

`rain.provider(...)` is a `suspend` function — resolving the Turnkey provider probes the Turnkey
wallet list and throws `RainError.WalletUnavailable` if no usable Ethereum account is available
(in managed mode, resolving before a session is live throws `RainError.TokenExpired`).
You can register other adapters (e.g. `PortalProvider`) on the same builder and resolve each
independently; each provider resolves on its own.

## Managed mode (internal API)

Managed mode is not a host-facing mode. Every member of it — the `TurnkeyConfig(application, organizationId, authProxyConfigId, passkeyDomain?)` constructor, `sendLoginCode` / `confirmLoginCode` / `loginWithPasskey` / `signUpWithPasskey` / `addPasskey` / `sendContactVerificationCode` / `confirmContactVerification` / `logout` / `awaitSessionRestore` / `hasActiveSession` / `authState` / `currentAuthState`, the `managedPasskeyDomain` accessor, `LoginContact` and `TurnkeyAuthState` — is marked `@InternalRainTurnkeyApi`, a `@RequiresOptIn` annotation at error level: a host app that calls any of them gets a compile error naming the reason. It is the building block of the Rain wallet provider (`RainProvider` in `rain-wallet-android`), which exposes the same flow in Rain's own terms with no Turnkey types; that module opts in module-wide with `-opt-in=com.rain.sdk.turnkey.InternalRainTurnkeyApi`. The rest of this section documents the flow for that caller.

Before the first run, in the Turnkey dashboard: enable the **Auth Proxy** for your parent organization with **Email OTP** turned on, and **SMS OTP** as well when phone numbers are used (each auth method has its own toggle), copy its auth-proxy config id (it identifies the configuration and is safe to ship in the app; the Turnkey SDK sends it as the `X-Auth-Proxy-Config-ID` header on every proxy call), and set the code format (6–9 characters, numeric or alphanumeric; one setting shared by email and SMS) and the session lifetime (900 seconds by default) there. The SDK reads none of these settings; it obeys them. SMS authentication is a Turnkey Enterprise feature that Turnkey enables on request, off by default on top-level organizations. Leave the dashboard captcha off while this SDK pins Turnkey's Kotlin SDK 2.0.1: that SDK sends no captcha token, so an enabled captcha refuses every code request on both channels.

For passkeys, turn **Passkey** on in the same auth-proxy configuration (the sandbox configuration lists email, SMS and passkey) and pass `passkeyDomain` to the constructor: a registrable domain of at least two labels you control, such as `passkeys.example.com`, that serves `https://<domain>/.well-known/assetlinks.json` as `application/json` with no redirect, in the shape of Google's passkey example (the file under [Passkeys](#passkeys)): a statement for the site itself granting `delegate_permission/common.get_login_creds`, and an `android_app` statement granting both `delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls` and `delegate_permission/common.get_login_creds` that lists the app's package name and the SHA-256 fingerprint of every certificate that signs it (debug, upload and Play App Signing). Google Play services fetches the file from the device at every ceremony and judges it itself; during this SDK's QA a file carrying the app statement alone was refused with `RAIN_102` on every attempt while Google's asset-links API still reported the link as valid, so start from that shape. The sample's file at `https://passkeys.uptop.xyz/.well-known/assetlinks.json` is a working copy. The domain is permanent, because every passkey created against it stops working when it changes, and a passkey made for one domain does not work in an app on another. Null or blank turns the passkey methods off (they throw `RainError.InvalidConfig` before any Turnkey call); a scheme, port, path or a single label such as `localhost` throws `RAIN_102` from the constructor. On the device the flows need Android 9 or later; on Android 9 to 13 Google Play services (the passkey provider the SDK's dependencies bring), on Android 14 and later any installed credential provider; a screen lock and a provider with a signed-in account. An emulator needs a Play image with a Google account added. When Turnkey has enabled the `WEBAUTHN_ORIGINS` feature on your parent organization, its allowed origins must include the Android origin `android:apk-key-hash:<base64url SHA-256 of the signing certificate>`, one per certificate.

The SDK configures Turnkey against your parent organization and auth-proxy configuration, runs the one-time-code flow, email or SMS, and the passkey flows on the provider itself, and provisions one wallet holding an Ethereum and a Solana account on first login:

```kotlin
import com.rain.sdk.RainSdk
import com.rain.sdk.provider.ProviderId
import com.rain.sdk.turnkey.LoginContact
import com.rain.sdk.turnkey.TurnkeyConfig
import com.rain.sdk.turnkey.TurnkeyProvider

val provider = TurnkeyProvider(
    TurnkeyConfig(
        application = application,
        organizationId = "<your-parent-organization-id>",
        authProxyConfigId = "<your-auth-proxy-config-id>",
        passkeyDomain = "passkeys.example.com", // optional; omit it to run codes only
    )
)

// Reuse a restored session, or run the code flow:
provider.awaitSessionRestore()
if (!provider.hasActiveSession()) {
    provider.sendLoginCode(LoginContact.Email("user@example.com"))
    // or by SMS, with the phone number in E.164 form:
    // provider.sendLoginCode(LoginContact.Phone("+15551234567"))
    provider.confirmLoginCode(code) // sign-up or login + Ethereum/Solana account provisioning
    // or, with passkeyDomain set, a passkey through the system sheet, presented from the
    // foreground Activity: an existing account
    // provider.loginWithPasskey(activity)
    // or a new account whose only login is the passkey
    // provider.signUpWithPasskey(activity)
}

val rain = RainSdk.builder()
    .rpcEndpoints(mapOf(84532 to "https://sepolia.base.org"))
    .register(provider)
    .build()
val client = rain.provider(ProviderId.TURNKEY)
```

### Passkeys

`loginWithPasskey(activity)` signs an existing user in through the system passkey sheet; `signUpWithPasskey(activity)` creates a new sub-organization with the passkey as its only root credential and the same wallet a code sign-up gets, then signs it in; `addPasskey(activity)` registers another passkey, bound to `passkeyDomain`, on the signed-in account. All three take the foreground `Activity` the sheet is presented from, suspend until it closes, and end with the caller's cancellation, never a mapped error, when the calling coroutine is cancelled; the SDK keeps the Activity no longer than the call. Every passkey login reuses the code login's session handling: the session lands under a fresh per-attempt key, is selected explicitly over a live session, the superseded session is cleared, the user's other sessions are revoked (`invalidateExisting`), and a missing account is backfilled. That switch and backfill run after the ceremony, so a login that succeeded can still end in `RainError.TokenExpired` or `RainError.Unauthorized`; a backfill failure keeps the session, which heals at resolution, and an unusable backend response inside the ceremony is `RainError.InternalError`. Without a `passkeyDomain` the three throw `RainError.InvalidConfig` before any Turnkey call. `signUpWithPasskey` is refused with `RainError.InvalidConfig` while a live session is stored as this device's current one (an expired one is cleared first, with `onSessionExpired` silent, and the sign-up proceeds), so call `logout()` first when `hasActiveSession()` is true, because Turnkey's Kotlin SDK swaps its process-wide client for a temporary-key client for the whole sign-up ceremony, and a wallet call made meanwhile would read the live session as dead. Every call to it mints a fresh account; returning users sign in or add a passkey, and accounts never merge. If the sign-up request succeeded but the login that followed failed, the account exists and `loginWithPasskey` reaches it; if the sign-up request itself failed, no account exists and the passkey the sheet created signs into nothing. Both arrive as `RAIN_501`. The passkey a sign-up registers is named `passkey-<unix seconds>`, a cross-platform contract shared by Rain's SDKs. `addPasskey` checks the session before the sheet; a session revoked server-side between that check and the registration still surfaces as `RainError.TokenExpired` after the prompt, and a registration the backend refused leaves a passkey on the device that signs into nothing. The passkey requests ask the credential provider for user verification as preferred, not required, so gate `addPasskey` as you gate export.

The association file the device accepts, in the shape of Google's passkey example; the sample's file at `https://passkeys.uptop.xyz/.well-known/assetlinks.json` follows it:

```json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.get_login_creds"],
    "target": { "namespace": "web", "site": "https://passkeys.example.com" }
  },
  {
    "relation": [
      "delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls",
      "delegate_permission/common.get_login_creds"
    ],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "com.example.app",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["<SHA-256 of each signing certificate, colon-separated hex>"]
    }
  }
]
```

### Attaching a contact

`sendContactVerificationCode(contact)` sends a one-time code to an email or phone the signed-in user wants to attach to this account as a login method, and `confirmContactVerification(code)` verifies it and sets the account's email or phone through Turnkey's update-user activities. The code is verified without logging in, since the SDK asks the auth proxy for a verification token with a throwaway key it deletes afterwards, then submits the update under the live session, so the session is required and checked before the code is spent (`RainError.TokenExpired` otherwise). The pending challenge is separate from the login code's, so neither flow can consume the other's code; a second send for the same contact replaces it and a send for another contact or channel retires it first, so a failed switch leaves nothing confirmable; it is kept on a rejected code (`RainError.InvalidLoginCode`, or `RainError.ProviderError` for a rejection the proxy wraps in an HTTP 500), dropped once the code was accepted, and dropped by a login or a logout. Turnkey checks that the contact is free, and a contact another sub-organization already owns is refused (`RainError.Unauthorized` when the update is refused, `RainError.ProviderError` otherwise) and never moves wallets. Afterwards that contact signs in to this account with `sendLoginCode` / `confirmLoginCode`. The SDK adds no user-presence check before the attach beyond the live session, which can be one restored at launch, so gate the two calls as you gate export (a biometric prompt or a fresh login) and show the user which contacts sign in to the account; the passkey requests ask for user verification as preferred, not required, so gate `addPasskey` the same way.

- `authState` (a `Flow<TurnkeyAuthState>`, snapshot via `currentAuthState()`) reports `Loading` / `Authenticated` / `Unauthenticated`. It is a view over the same derivation as `sessionState`, collapsing an expired session into `Unauthenticated` — a login screen only needs to know whether a code is required. Until the first auth call (`awaitSessionRestore`, `sendLoginCode`, …) has configured Turnkey and its restore has settled, `authState` reads `Loading` and `hasActiveSession()` is `false` — call `awaitSessionRestore()` before reading either.
- A rejected code throws `RainError.InvalidLoginCode` (`RAIN_203`) and keeps the challenge, so the user can retype it. Any other failure inside the code check itself also keeps the challenge — the auth proxy has been seen wrapping a rejection in an HTTP 500 whose body carries the real status, which the Kotlin SDK discards before Rain sees it, so that case surfaces as `RainError.ProviderError` (`RAIN_501`) on Android, while the iOS SDK reads the body and reports `RAIN_203` for the same wrong code. The difference stays until Turnkey's Kotlin SDK forwards the body. On Android, treat `RAIN_501` from `confirmLoginCode` as retryable. The user can retry the code or request a new one. A failure after the code was accepted drops the challenge; if that failure is the switch to the new session, the device is signed out as well — the login already revoked the previous session server-side, so keeping it selected would only fail at the next wallet call — and `onSessionExpired` stays silent because the thrown error is the signal. A provisioning failure keeps the new session (see below). A rejected code never touches an existing session: each login stores its session under a fresh key and switches to it only on success.
- Turnkey's limits on the code flow, which the SDK cannot see and your UI has to design around: a code is valid for 5 minutes by default (up to 10 in the dashboard), locks after 3 wrong attempts, and at most 3 codes can be active per user — an expired or locked code surfaces as the same `RAIN_203` (or `ProviderError`) as a typo. Request a new code by calling `sendLoginCode` again with the same contact; it replaces the pending challenge on success and keeps it on failure. A call for another contact or channel retires the pending challenge before the request, so a failed switch leaves nothing confirmable. Codes may be alphanumeric, so never force a numeric keyboard, for SMS as much as for email: the code format is one shared setting. Turnkey also limits code requests to 3 per 3 minutes per user identifier, but the auth-proxy request carries no such identifier, so per-user throttling and restricting the destination countries you serve are your app's job; Turnkey's own guidance treats SMS as spend an attacker can drive.
- A phone number is trimmed, stripped of spaces, dots, hyphens and parentheses, and must then be E.164 (`+`, country code and number, at most 15 digits): `LoginContact.Phone("+1 (555) 123-4567")` sends `+15551234567`. A national number without its country code is refused with `RainError.InvalidConfig` before any proxy call, and so is a parenthesised trunk zero such as `+44 (0) 20 ...`, which stripping would turn into a different number; convert national formats in your app first (the sample uses `PhoneNumberUtils.formatNumberToE164` with the device's region). The canonical string is the account's identity, so the same string is sent on confirm and used for the account lookup.
- Turnkey's sandbox simulates SMS delivery: the test number `+1 999-999-9999` with the code `000000` works once the proxy's code format is numeric and 6 characters, a setting that changes email codes on the same configuration too.
- A successful login revokes the user's other Turnkey sessions server-side (`invalidateExisting`) and clears the previous local session once the switch to the new one succeeded. The signed-out device's `onSessionExpired` fires at its next call. `hasActiveSession()` reflects the local expiry only — a session revoked from another device reads as active until its first call fails.
- `logout()` clears the selected session — after waiting for a restore in flight to settle — and does **not** fire `onSessionExpired`; cached accounts are still evicted and a pending login code and a pending contact verification are dropped. With no session selected it is a no-op.
- A first sign-up creates its wallet inside the signup request: one wallet named `Wallet`, 12-word mnemonic, Ethereum `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` (secp256k1) and Solana `m/44'/501'/0'/0'` (ed25519) — a cross-platform contract shared by Rain's SDKs, so a user provisioned on one platform resolves identically on another. Afterwards, missing accounts are added to the wallet Rain resolves (`createWalletAccounts`); only an organization with no wallet at all gets a new one, so the user has a single mnemonic to back up either way.
- A sign-up creates one Turnkey **sub-organization** per end user under your parent organization. The user is its only root user, with the credential the flow used: the verified contact, email address or phone number, for a code sign-up, or the passkey for a passkey sign-up; `addPasskey` and the contact-attach methods add more later. The root quorum is the user alone: the parent organization has read-only visibility and can neither reach the keys nor sign. An account is keyed on the credential it signed up with: the same person logging in by email once and by SMS once, or by a code once and with `signUpWithPasskey` once, gets two sub-organizations, two wallets and two mnemonics, unless the second login method was attached to the first account while signed in (`addPasskey`, or `sendContactVerificationCode` / `confirmContactVerification`). Accounts never merge. Treat one credential as one account, or attach the second login method to the existing account before offering it to existing users. An SMS sign-up gets Turnkey's default names for the root user and the organization, since there is no email to name them after. The wallet above is created inside that same signup request, and every session and wallet call is scoped to the sub-organization. Deleting a sub-organization is a root-user activity that requires its wallets to have been exported first (or `deleteWithoutExport`) and is not exposed by this SDK.
- The Turnkey configuration is one-shot per app launch and is applied by the first auth call (`awaitSessionRestore`, `sendLoginCode`, `confirmLoginCode`, the passkey and contact-attach methods, `logout`) or by provider resolution, whichever comes first. Blank ids, a second managed provider with *different* ids or a different `passkeyDomain`, or a `TurnkeyContext` your app initialized itself make every auth call throw `RainError.InvalidConfig` — relaunch to change ids, or use bring-your-own mode. If Turnkey's own initialization fails or never finishes, every auth call throws `RainError.InternalError` until the app relaunches. Wrong but well-formed ids, SMS OTP not enabled on the proxy configuration, or an undeliverable number are not detected at configuration time: the first auth-proxy call fails instead, and the code request comes back with an HTTP status and no reason (the Kotlin SDK drops the response body), surfaced as `RainError.ProviderError`.
- Resolving the provider before a session is live throws `RainError.TokenExpired`. Resolution also re-checks the account set, so a login whose provisioning failed heals itself without a new code.
- Managed mode needs an `android.app.Application` because Turnkey's Kotlin SDK stores sessions and device keys through it.

The Rain wallet module is this flow's caller; the sample app drives it through `RainSession.prepareRainWallet` / `initializeRainWallet` and `HomeViewModel`. The sample's Turnkey tab is bring-your-own (`TurnkeyAuthSample` plus `RainSession.initializeTurnkey`) and touches none of these members.

## What Rain uses Turnkey for

After the Turnkey-backed `client` is resolved, every wallet operation routes through Turnkey:

| Rain operation | Turnkey API used |
|----------------|------------------|
| `client.getWalletAddress()` | `TurnkeyContext.wallets` (first Ethereum account) |
| `client.getBalance(chainId, Token.Native)` | `TurnkeyClient.getWalletAddressBalances` (CAIP-19 `slip44:` filter) on supported chains; RPC `eth_getBalance` otherwise |
| `client.getBalance(chainId, Token.Contract(...))` | RPC `eth_call` (`balanceOf`) |
| `client.getTokenBalances(chainId)` | `TurnkeyClient.getWalletAddressBalances` (CAIP-19) on supported chains; Multicall3 / parallel `eth_call` otherwise |
| `client.sendNative(...)` / `client.sendToken(...)` | `TurnkeyClient.ethSendTransaction` + `getSendTransactionStatus` polling. Only on Turnkey's managed-broadcast chains — other chains (Avalanche, Celo, ZKsync, Plasma, Ink) are read-only and sends throw `RAIN_104` up front. By default (`sponsorGas = true`), every EVM send (transfers, withdrawals, approvals, raw sends) is sponsored by Turnkey Gas Station (minimal payload carrying Turnkey's gas-station nonce for replay protection; fee estimates quote what the wallet would pay itself), and Solana network fees are sponsored too (a zero-SOL sender skips the fee check and dry run; rent for a new recipient token account is a separate Turnkey toggle and stays with the sender). `TurnkeyConfig(sponsorGas = false)` returns to self-paid sends, and is required on a Turnkey organization without sponsorship enabled. Monad caveat: Turnkey sponsors through EIP-7702 delegation and Monad reverts any delegated-account transaction that would leave the balance under 10 MON, so a sponsored native MON send from a small wallet fails on chain even when the estimate succeeds (token sends are unaffected). |
| `client.withdrawCollateral(...)` | EVM: `TurnkeyContext.signRawPayload` (EIP-712) + `ethSendTransaction`. Solana: core composes the withdrawal, skipping its self-paid dry run while the adapter sponsors the fee, then `solSendTransaction`. Either chain: a chain outside Turnkey's coverage is refused with `RAIN_104` before anything is read or signed (`prepareWithdrawal` is not refused, because it never broadcasts), and a status carrying decoded revert details (`error.revertChain` or `error.eth.revertChain`, whether the transaction failed before inclusion or was included and reverted, or a Solana `InstructionError` or the runtime's `Program <id> failed` log line) surfaces as `WithdrawalRevertedByNetwork`, the same as a failed dry run, with the transaction hash on `transactionId` and in the message once included; a failed status without them (a broadcast, policy or blockhash failure) is `ProviderError`, and a Solana fee or rent shortfall is `InsufficientFunds`. |
| `client.getTransactions(...)` | `TurnkeyClient.listEthTransactionHistory`, the indexed history (receives and externally submitted transactions included, EVM addresses in EIP-55 form), when the transaction history feature is enabled for the organization; otherwise `TurnkeyClient.getActivities` filtered to `ACTIVITY_TYPE_ETH_SEND_TRANSACTION`, sends only. The fallback runs only when Turnkey refuses the indexed query (HTTP 403 for an organization without the feature, logged once per provider); a dead session, a transport failure or a page that could not be decoded surfaces as its own error. |
| `client.estimateGas(...)` | RPC `eth_estimateGas` + `eth_gasPrice` on every chain. On a sponsored chain the quote is what the wallet would pay itself; a sponsor pays instead and its own cost is not quoted |

On Solana chain ids the same methods route to `TurnkeyClient.solSendTransaction` /
`getWalletAddressBalances` and the Solana account instead — see [Solana notes](#solana-notes).

## Solana notes

The Turnkey adapter is the SDK's multi-chain provider (it advertises `MULTI_CHAIN`): Solana sentinel
chain ids (`RainChain.SOLANA_MAINNET` 900 / `SOLANA_DEVNET` 901 / `SOLANA_TESTNET` 902) route
`getWalletAddress(chainId)`, balances, `sendNative`, `sendToken`, `withdrawCollateral`, and
`getTransactions` to the Turnkey Solana account.

- **Transfers.** Composition and every preflight live in core's `SolanaTransferComposer` (shared with
  the Privy adapter, so the two cannot drift); the adapter only signs and broadcasts. For SPL that
  covers recipient validation, resolving the mint's decimals and owning token program on chain,
  deriving both associated token accounts, creating the recipient's when missing
  (`CreateIdempotent`, ~0.002 SOL rent paid by the sender), fee checks, and a `simulateTransaction`
  dry run (with `sponsorGas` the fee check and dry run are skipped, the rent check stays, and the
  System Program is carried among the static account keys because Turnkey's sponsored-flow rules
  require it). Failures
  surface as `TokenNotFound`, `TokenAccountNotFound`,
  `InsufficientTokenBalance`, or `InvalidRecipient`.
- **Balances.** From Turnkey's `get-balances` where it indexes the cluster; where it doesn't (devnet
  in particular), `getTokenBalances` discovers holdings from the node via `getTokenAccountsByOwner`
  against both token programs. Solana keeps token metadata off chain, so symbol / name stay null
  unless the mint is registered.
- **History.** From Turnkey's indexed history (`list_sol_transaction_history`) when the transaction
  history feature is enabled for the organization: receives included, and the row's hash is the real
  signature. Otherwise from the activity log (`ACTIVITY_TYPE_SOL_SEND_TRANSACTION`), sends only,
  where the row's hash is the Turnkey status id, not an explorer-resolvable signature.
- **Encoding.** Turnkey hex-decodes `unsignedTransaction` despite the type documenting base64, so
  Rain sends hex. Turnkey returns a status id rather than a signature; Rain polls for it, then
  recovers it from `getSignaturesForAddress` (newer than the pre-send baseline only) and verifies
  via `getTransaction` that the candidate is signed by this wallet (the fee payer on a self-paid
  send; on a sponsored send Turnkey's payer model is undocumented, so the check is on signers) with
  `err == null`. If the
  baseline read failed or nothing verifiable lands in time, the send surfaces as
  `TransactionPending` carrying the status id — the same contract as EVM — never the status id
  posing as a signature.
- **Collateral withdrawal.** Authorized differently from EVM: the coordinator executor signs a
  keccak-encoded withdraw message off chain (that is the admin signature the Rain API returns). Core
  composes a two-instruction transaction — a native ed25519 proof that the executor signed that exact
  message, then the program's `withdraw_single_signer_collateral_asset` — reading the collateral
  account, its coordinator's executors, and the mint's token program from chain, and deriving the
  collateral-authority PDA and token accounts locally. It simulates (self-paid only; a fee-sponsored
  provider skips the dry run on `withdrawCollateral`, never on `prepareWithdrawal`), then hands the bytes to the
  adapter, which signs them **as-is**: re-serializing would invalidate the embedded signature.
  `proxyAddress` is the collateral account, `tokenAddress` the SPL mint; single-signer collateral
  only. `prepareWithdrawal` returns the prepared unsigned transaction with its blockhash.

## Signing

EIP-712 signing uses `TurnkeyContext.signRawPayload` with `PAYLOAD_ENCODING_EIP712` + `HASH_FUNCTION_NO_OP`. Rain normalizes the returned `r`, `s`, `v` components into a `0x`-prefixed 65-byte hex signature compatible with `eth_signTypedData_v4` responses (recovery id auto-adjusted to 27/28 range when needed).

## Key export

`TurnkeyProvider` exports the wallet's recovery phrase and one private key per chain family, in bring-your-own and managed mode alike. The methods live on the descriptor, so a host can offer a backup right after login, before the SDK is built.

```kotlin
val provider = TurnkeyProvider(TurnkeyConfig(turnkey = TurnkeyContext))

val phrase = provider.exportRecoveryPhrase()                              // space-separated BIP-39 words
val ethereumKey = provider.exportPrivateKey(TurnkeyKeyFamily.ETHEREUM)   // "0x" + 64 lowercase hex characters
val solanaKey = provider.exportPrivateKey(TurnkeyKeyFamily.SOLANA)       // plain Base58 of the 64-byte seed || public key
```

**Formats**, a cross-platform contract shared by Rain's SDKs:

- Recovery phrase: the wallet's BIP-39 phrase as the wallet was created. Managed wallets have 12 words. A bring-your-own wallet has the length it was created with.
- Ethereum: the 32-byte secp256k1 key as `0x` plus 64 lowercase hex characters, the form MetaMask's *Import account* accepts.
- Solana: the 64-byte keypair, the seed followed by the ed25519 public key, in plain Base58 with no checksum, the form Phantom's *Import private key* accepts.

**Which wallet and account.** Keys follow the accounts the SDK signs with. The Ethereum key is the account behind `getWalletAddress()`, including a `walletAddress` override, and the Solana key is the account behind the Solana address. The phrase is the wallet holding that Ethereum account, else the first wallet, so the phrase and the Ethereum key always derive the same address. It restores every account derived from that wallet's seed and nothing else. A managed wallet keeps both accounts on one seed, so one phrase covers both. A bring-your-own organization with several wallets gets one wallet's phrase, and a key may come from another wallet. Before returning anything the SDK checks that the key is 32 bytes and that the address it derives, on either curve, is the account's. A `walletAddress` that names no Ethereum account of the organization fails every export before any export call, the Solana key included, because the provider it configures cannot sign either.

**Session.** Export is a Turnkey submit activity, so it needs a session that can submit; the one-time-code login produces one. Any live session suffices, including one the vendor restored from disk at launch: the SDK performs no re-authentication of its own, so a host that wants a fresh login or a biometric prompt before export adds it. A missing session, or one Turnkey refuses to submit with, a read-only bring-your-own session for example, fails the call; [Key export errors](#key-export-errors) has the mapping. In managed mode the first export of a launch runs the one-shot configuration first, like every auth call. Export is the backup path for a user who signs in with a passkey only.

**Timing and retries.** The vendor polls the export activity for up to about four seconds; an activity still pending after that fails the call ([Key export errors](#key-export-errors)). A transient failure (408, 429, 5xx, a dropped connection) is retried with a new request, so Turnkey's audit log may show more than one export activity for one call. Turnkey marks the wallet as exported after a phrase export, and its delete-wallet and delete-sub-organization activities key on that flag, so a phrase export changes what an organization can later delete without a force option.

**Host duties.** The SDK decrypts on the device and hands the value back once. It never logs, caches or persists it. After the return, gate the call, for example behind biometrics, show the value where screenshots and screen recording are blocked, and keep it off the clipboard or clear it. The sample app's *Export keys* card shows one way to do each. See [app/README.md](../app/README.md).

**What leaves the device.** The wallet id or the account address, the organization id and a fresh P-256 public key go to Turnkey's export endpoints; an enclave-signed bundle encrypted to that key comes back and is decrypted on the device. Nothing goes to Rain.

**Capability resolution.** `TurnkeyProvider` now advertises `Capability.EXPORT`, so `rain.first { Capability.EXPORT in it.capabilities }` returns the Turnkey client in a host that registered Turnkey before Portal or Privy, where it returned one of those before. `first` returns the earliest registered match. The client it returns has no export method; the methods live on the `TurnkeyProvider` the host registered.

**Checking an import.** Restore the phrase in MetaMask: the first Ethereum account equals `getWalletAddress()`. Restore it in Phantom: the Solana account equals the Solana address. Import the Ethereum key in MetaMask and the Solana key in Phantom: the same two addresses.

**Minified builds.** Export makes the vendor's `decryptExportBundle` reachable. Its Solana branch, which Rain never takes because it builds the Solana keypair itself, calls a helper in `com.turnkey:encoding` that links `org.bitcoinj.core.Base58`, a class bitcoinj 0.17.1 (the project's security floor) no longer ships. The adapter's published consumer rules carry `-dontwarn org.bitcoinj.core.Base58`, so a minified host build does not fail on the dangling reference. The branch is dead code on this classpath. The rule reaches the host's whole R8 configuration, so host code that still references `org.bitcoinj.core.Base58` itself, or calls the vendor's Solana export format directly, is silenced too and throws `NoClassDefFoundError` at runtime; move such code to `org.bitcoinj.base.Base58` or the SDK's export. The rule goes once Turnkey's encoding artifact targets `org.bitcoinj.base.Base58`.

## Accessing the Turnkey instance

Rain exposes no vendor getters (core references no concrete vendor type). In bring-your-own mode you already own the `TurnkeyContext`
you authenticated and passed to `TurnkeyConfig`. In managed mode the SDK configured that same
process-wide `TurnkeyContext` object; it is reachable because it is a public vendor type, but treat
it as read-only — creating, selecting or clearing sessions behind Rain's back is unsupported, and
the vendor configuration itself is one-shot per launch.

## Error handling

Turnkey-specific errors are mapped into the standard `RainError` hierarchy. Whichever vendor wrapper carries a Turnkey HTTP failure and whichever row below produces the error, a `ProviderError` or `InternalError` reaches the host with the call and the status only, as `HTTP error from <path or activity>: <status>`; the response body never does.

| Turnkey error | Mapped to |
|---------------|-----------|
| `TurnkeyKotlinError.InvalidSession` | `RainError.TokenExpired` |
| `TurnkeyKotlinError.FailedToVerifyOtp` carrying an auth-proxy HTTP 400 / 401 / 403 (managed mode) | `RainError.InvalidLoginCode` (`RAIN_203`) — the code was refused; 408 / 429 / 5xx are not a refused code and surface as `RainError.ProviderError` (`RAIN_501`); the auth path does not retry them. A rejection the proxy wraps in an HTTP 500 (real status only in the response body) is `RAIN_501` on Android, because the Kotlin SDK drops the body before Rain sees it, and `RAIN_203` on iOS; the challenge is still kept for a retry |
| `TurnkeyKotlinError.FailedToInitOtp`, any auth-proxy HTTP status (managed mode) | `RainError.ProviderError` (`RAIN_501`): the code request failed. No session exists while a code is requested, so a 401 or 403 here is not `TokenExpired` or `Unauthorized`. The reason (the channel not enabled on the proxy configuration, an undeliverable number, a rate limit) is in the response body the Kotlin SDK drops, so only the status reaches the message. Request the code again or check the configuration |
| `TurnkeyKotlinError.FailedToLoginWithPasskey` / `FailedToSignUpWithPasskey`, `TurnkeyPasskeyError`, `TurnkeyStamperError` (managed passkey flows) | By the decisive cause in the chain. A Credential Manager cancellation, a `NoCredentialException` or a `NotAllowedError` DOM error whose message says cancelled: `RainError.UserRejected` (`RAIN_401`), the current session untouched. A `SecurityError` or `DataError` DOM error: `RainError.InvalidConfig` (`RAIN_102`), the association file, the fingerprint or the domain does not match this build, or the file lacks the site's own statement (see [Passkeys](#passkeys)); current Play services builds report that check as `DataError` (their code 50152), older ones as `SecurityError`. Any auth-proxy or Turnkey API HTTP status inside a passkey login or sign-up: `RainError.ProviderError` (`RAIN_501`), because no session exists yet, so it is never `RAIN_201` or `RAIN_202`; the body is discarded as for the code flow. A missing passkey provider (`*ProviderConfigurationException`) or any other Credential Manager exception: `RAIN_501`. A nested `KeyAlreadyExists` or `InvalidResponse`: `RainError.InternalError` (`RAIN_502`) |
| Turnkey API HTTP 401 | `RainError.TokenExpired` |
| Turnkey API HTTP 403 | `RainError.Unauthorized` |
| `TurnkeyKotlinError.FailedToExportWallet`, and the checks the adapter runs around an export | [Key export errors](#key-export-errors) below: one table, in the order the checks run |
| Config / setup errors (`MissingRpId`, which managed mode cannot raise, since the SDK passes the domain on every passkey call and refuses the flow with `RAIN_102` when none is configured; `MissingConfigParam`, `ClientNotInitialized`, `InvalidParameter`, `InvalidResponse`, `InvalidMessage`, `InvalidRefreshTTL`, `OAuthStateMismatch`, `KeyAlreadyExists`, `KeyNotFound`) | `RainError.InternalError` |
| Wrapper errors whose underlying cause is a user cancellation | `RainError.UserRejected` |
| A failed `getSendTransactionStatus` after a send | `RainError.WithdrawalRevertedByNetwork` (withdrawals) or `RainError.TransactionSimulationFailed` (transfers) with decoded revert details, `RainError.InsufficientFunds` for a Solana fee or rent shortfall, `RainError.ProviderError` otherwise; see the `withdrawCollateral` row in the mapping table above |
| Anything else | `RainError.ProviderError` |

The Turnkey Kotlin SDK throws a plain `RuntimeException` for HTTP failures and carries the status
only inside the message, so the adapter's `TurnkeyErrorMapping` parses it out. That is a workaround for a vendor gap —
it becomes a typed check once the SDK exposes the status code.

Network errors raised during direct RPC calls (balances, fee estimation) surface as `RainError.NetworkError`.

### Key export errors

The one statement of the export error contract. The KDoc of `exportRecoveryPhrase` and `exportPrivateKey` and their rows in [METHODS.md](METHODS.md#turnkey-key-export) point here instead of repeating it. Conditions are listed in the order the checks run, so the first that holds is the error a call gets; the session is checked when the wallet list has to be fetched and again at the export call itself.

| Condition | Mapped to |
|-----------|-----------|
| The provider was closed | `RainError.InvalidConfig` (`RAIN_102`), before anything else |
| No live session when the wallet list is fetched, or at the export call | `RainError.TokenExpired` (`RAIN_201`) |
| `walletAddress` names no Ethereum account of the organization: the phrase and both keys, before any export call | `RainError.InvalidConfig` (`RAIN_102`) |
| No wallet to export a phrase from, or no account of the requested chain family, before any export call | `RainError.WalletUnavailable` (`RAIN_404`). In managed mode, logging in again provisions the account |
| The account of the requested family sits on another curve than the family's, before any export call | `RainError.WalletUnavailable` (`RAIN_404`). Inconsistent vendor data; logging in again does not repair it |
| Turnkey answers the export with HTTP 401 | `RainError.TokenExpired` (`RAIN_201`) after one refresh attempt |
| Turnkey answers the export with HTTP 403, a read-only bring-your-own session for example | `RainError.Unauthorized` (`RAIN_202`). Which status Turnkey sends for a read-only session is not confirmed against the sandbox yet |
| Any other status, or a transient failure (408, 429, 5xx, a dropped connection) that still fails after the retries | `RainError.ProviderError` (`RAIN_501`): the same cause inspection as every other `FailedToExportWallet` wrapper |
| The export activity is still pending after the vendor's polling of about four seconds | `RainError.ProviderError` (`RAIN_501`) |
| The enclave's bundle names another account than the one requested (keys only) | `RainError.ProviderError` (`RAIN_501`) with a fixed message, before anything is decrypted |
| The export bundle is rejected on the device (signature, organization mismatch, malformed) | `RainError.ProviderError` (`RAIN_501`) naming the rejection kind only. The vendor's own message can carry the ephemeral decryption key, so the adapter drops it before anything is logged |
| The exported key fails a check: not 32 bytes, outside the curve order, or it does not derive the account's address (keys only) | `RainError.InternalError` (`RAIN_502`) with a fixed message. Nothing is returned |

## Session expiry, refresh, and retry

Turnkey sessions are short-lived JWTs (15 minutes by default) that die silently once expired.
Rain hardens every Turnkey-backed call against this, controlled by `TurnkeySessionPolicy`:

```kotlin
TurnkeyProvider(
    TurnkeyConfig(
        turnkey = turnkeyContext,
        sessionPolicy = TurnkeySessionPolicy(
            refreshBufferSeconds = 60,        // refresh when < 60s of lifetime remain
            autoRefresh = true,               // let Rain call Turnkey's refreshSession itself
            refreshExpirationSeconds = null,  // TTL for refreshed sessions (null = Turnkey default)
            maxTransientRetries = 2,          // backoff retries for 5xx/429/network on reads
            initialRetryDelayMs = 500,
            maxRetryDelayMs = 4_000,
        ),
        onSessionExpired = {
            // Re-auth hook: the session died and could not be refreshed. Fired once per
            // session death, on the calling coroutine's thread or the watcher's — hop to the
            // main thread before touching UI. Route the user back to login.
        },
    )
)
```

What every wallet call now does:

1. **Expiry check** — the session's JWT expiry is checked before the request. An
   already-expired session throws `RainError.TokenExpired` (or is refreshed first, see below)
   instead of burning a round-trip on a guaranteed 401.
2. **Proactive refresh** — with `autoRefresh` on (the default), a session expired or inside
   `refreshBufferSeconds` of expiry is refreshed through Turnkey's `refreshSession` before the
   call. Refreshes are single-flighted: concurrent calls share one refresh. Turnkey's refresh
   rotates the key but leaves its public `session` flow on the old session, so Rain re-selects the
   session afterwards. That reload also refreshes Turnkey's user and wallet state (its
   `autoRefreshManagedStates`, on by default) and fires the `onSessionSelected` hook of the
   `TurnkeyConfig` a bring-your-own host passed to `TurnkeyContext.init`. A reload that fails is
   logged and is not a session death.
3. **Refresh-on-401** — a call rejected with HTTP 401 / `InvalidSession` is refreshed and
   retried exactly once. A 401 means Turnkey rejected the request before executing it, so this
   is safe for sends too. A second 401 surfaces as `RainError.TokenExpired`.
4. **Transient backoff** — idempotent reads (balances, history, transaction-status polls) and
   key export retry HTTP 5xx/429/408 and network I/O failures with exponential backoff; a retried
   export is a new activity with a fresh ephemeral key. Sends and signing are never retried on
   transient failures.
5. **Re-auth hook** — when the session dies for good (refresh failed, or Turnkey's own expiry
   timer cleared it while the app was idle), `onSessionExpired` fires once — even with no Rain
   call in flight, via a passive watcher over Turnkey's auth state.

With `autoRefresh = false` Rain never touches the session: expired sessions and 401s surface
as `RainError.TokenExpired` immediately and refresh/re-auth is entirely the host's job.

### Observing session state

`TurnkeyProvider` exposes the session as seen at the Rain boundary:

```kotlin
val provider = TurnkeyProvider(TurnkeyConfig(turnkeyContext))

provider.currentSessionState()  // Loading | Active(expiresAtEpochSeconds) | Expired | Unauthenticated

scope.launch {
    provider.sessionState.collect { state ->
        if (state is TurnkeySessionState.Expired || state is TurnkeySessionState.Unauthenticated) {
            // show re-login UI
        }
    }
}

provider.refreshSession()  // manual refresh; throws RainError.TokenExpired when it fails
```

`sessionState` emits on every Turnkey auth/session change and additionally re-checks when an
active session passes its expiry instant, so a silent death is observable without polling.

Resolving the provider always starts a passive watcher over the process-wide Turnkey singleton —
it evicts cached accounts when the session dies and fires `onSessionExpired` when one is set. A
host that rebuilds the SDK per login should call
`provider.close()` on the provider it is discarding so a stale watcher cannot fire.

Reference: the sample app's `RainSession.kt`, `WalletSessionStatus.kt` and the Home screen's
session card (`HomeScreen.kt`, `SessionCard`).

## Registering alongside Portal

The one pair that cannot share a builder is `TurnkeyProvider` and the Rain wallet's `RainProvider`
(`rain-wallet-android`): both drive the same process-wide `TurnkeyContext`, so `build()` throws
`RainError.InvalidConfig` when both are registered, and an app that configured one of them in a
launch cannot switch to the other without a relaunch.

Turnkey and Portal can share one builder. Register both adapters on the same builder and
resolve each to its own `RainClient` — one SDK instance, two independent provider-bound clients:

```kotlin
val rain = RainSdk.builder()
    .rpcEndpoints(endpoints)
    .register(PortalProvider(PortalConfig(portalSessionToken)))
    .register(TurnkeyProvider(TurnkeyConfig(turnkeyContext)))
    .build()

val portalClient = rain.provider(ProviderId.PORTAL)
val turnkeyClient = rain.provider(ProviderId.TURNKEY)
```

Each client is bound to its provider for its lifetime; there is no "active provider" to swap.

## Bouncy Castle dependency conflict (downstream consumers)

Turnkey (via `com.turnkey:crypto` and `com.turnkey:encoding`) depends on **`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15to18`**, and so does `rain-core-android`, which needs Bouncy Castle for web3j's Keccak hashing. Web3j 4.10 itself depends on **`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on:1.73`**. Both artifacts publish overlapping `org.bouncycastle.*` class names, so dex-ing them together fails with errors like:

```
Duplicate class org.bouncycastle.asn1.pkcs.EncryptionScheme found in modules
  bcprov-jdk15to18-1.82.jar -> bcprov-jdk15to18-1.82 (org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15to18:1.82)
  bcprov-jdk18on-1.73.jar  -> bcprov-jdk18on-1.73  (org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on:1.73)
```

The two artifacts are parallel builds of the same library for different JDK targets — their class APIs are interchangeable. Rain SDK standardizes on `bcprov-jdk15to18`, floored at the catalog's `bouncycastle` version (1.86 today) by a published constraint, and publishes the `bcprov-jdk18on` exclusion on every dependency edge that would otherwise pull it: web3j in core, Portal and Privy, and `privy-core` in the Privy module. The Turnkey adapter declares `bcprov-jdk15to18` itself as well, for the ed25519 derivation behind the exported Solana keypair. It is the same artifact at the same floor, so nothing new reaches a consumer's classpath, and the `bcprov-jdk18on` exclusion is unchanged.

**Gradle consumers** (resolve via Module Metadata): no action required as long as you reach the vendor SDKs only through Rain's modules. The exclusions above are part of the published metadata, and Gradle inherits them along each edge that declares them.

**If your build still hits the duplicate-class error** (older Gradle, Maven POM-only resolution, or you declare web3j, `io.privy:privy-core` or another dependency that pulls `bcprov-jdk18on` yourself), add the exclusion in your own module:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
configurations.all {
    exclude(group = "org.bouncycastle", module = "bcprov-jdk18on")
}
```

Or, if you'd rather scope it to a specific dependency:

```kotlin
implementation("org.web3j:core:4.10.3") {
    exclude(group = "org.bouncycastle", module = "bcprov-jdk18on")
}
```

Groovy DSL equivalent:

```groovy
configurations.all {
    exclude group: 'org.bouncycastle', module: 'bcprov-jdk18on'
}
```

Maven POM equivalent (for non-Gradle consumers):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.web3j</groupId>
    <artifactId>core</artifactId>
    <version>4.10.3</version>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
            <artifactId>bcprov-jdk18on</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

If you have a legitimate need for `bcprov-jdk18on` (e.g. another library you control), swap the exclusion the other way and ensure all consumers compile against the same single BC artifact.
