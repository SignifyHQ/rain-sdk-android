 * which for the user-update activities can echo the email or phone being attached, and every vendor
 * wrapper copies its cause's message into its own, which `ProviderError` copies into the message
 * hosts log. `ActivityNotCompleted` (http 2.2.0) is a data class whose `toString()` prints the whole
