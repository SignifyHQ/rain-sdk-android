## [Unreleased]

## [5.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-09-30

First public beta, published to Maven Central under `xyz.rain`. Pin the exact version during the
beta; see [Compatibility](README.md#compatibility).

### Added

- `xyz.rain:rain-core-android`, `rain-portal-android`, `rain-privy-android`, `rain-turnkey-android`
  and `rain-wallet-android`, all at `5.0.0-beta.1`.
- `@ExperimentalRainApi`. Implementing `WalletProvider`, `ProviderDescriptor` or `RainClient`
  requires opting in to it, because Rain may add members to these interfaces in any release.
