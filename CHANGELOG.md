# Changelog

Notable changes to the Rain Android SDK, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). An entry a host must act on starts with
**Breaking:** and carries a migration note.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Solana sends and collateral withdrawals through `rain-turnkey-android` and `rain-wallet-android`
  reach the chain: the wallet backend's client is `com.turnkey:sdk-kotlin` 2.0.2 with
  `com.turnkey:http` 2.1.1, which post the activity type the request body requires. On such a send,
  `RAIN_302` `TransactionPending` may carry the wallet backend's activity id when the backend accepted
  the send without a readable status id, and the activity-log history lists Solana sends under both
  of the backend's send activity types. See [TURNKEY_SUPPORT.md](docs/TURNKEY_SUPPORT.md#solana-notes).

## [5.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-09-30

First public beta, published to Maven Central under `xyz.rain`. Pin the exact version during the
beta; see [Compatibility](README.md#compatibility). Known issue: Solana sends and collateral
withdrawals through `rain-turnkey-android` and `rain-wallet-android` fail with `RAIN_501` before
anything is signed; the fix is listed under Unreleased above.

### Added

- `xyz.rain:rain-core-android`, `rain-portal-android`, `rain-privy-android`, `rain-turnkey-android`
  and `rain-wallet-android`, all at `5.0.0-beta.1`.
- `@ExperimentalRainApi`. Implementing `WalletProvider`, `ProviderDescriptor` or `RainClient`
  requires opting in to it, because Rain may add members to these interfaces in any release.
