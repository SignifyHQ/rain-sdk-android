# Changelog

Notable changes to the Rain Android SDK, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). An entry a host must act on starts with
**Breaking:** and carries a migration note.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Solana sends and collateral withdrawals through `rain-turnkey-android` and `rain-wallet-android`
  reach the chain: the wallet backend's client is `com.turnkey:sdk-kotlin` 2.0.2 with
  `com.turnkey:http` 2.1.1, which post the activity type the request body requires.
- With Privy, two refusals for a shortfall of the native currency that arrived with the wrong code
  are `RAIN_402` `InsufficientFunds`: an EVM send over the balance, which the `eth_call` preflight
  now reads through the shared classifier (it knows "EVM error: OutOfFunds", Base Sepolia's node's
  wording), and a Solana send from a wallet holding no SOL, which Privy's wallet API refuses with
  the node's "found no record of a prior credit". Every answer from that API other than a 401 or
  403, on any wallet-API call, is now read for a funds shortfall before it floors at `RAIN_501`. A
  Solana send from a wallet that holds some SOL but not the amount plus the fee is refused with a
  bare program error the SDK cannot read, so it still arrives as `RAIN_501`; core runs no native
  SOL preflight of its own.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `sendLoginCode` and `sendContactVerificationCode` lowercase an email before it
  reaches Turnkey, which matches emails case-sensitively: `Jo@Example.com` and `jo@example.com`
  signed up as two accounts with two wallets. Migration: an account created from a mixed-case email
  under 5.0.0-beta.1 is keyed on that exact spelling, and after this change a login with that
  address is lowercased, misses it and signs up a new, empty account. Rain cannot change the stored
  spelling, because the user is the sub-organization's only root. Before upgrading, have such users
  sign in on the current build and export the recovery phrase or move their funds out. Sandbox test
  accounts can simply be recreated.
- On a Solana send through `rain-turnkey-android` or `rain-wallet-android`, `RAIN_302`
  `TransactionPending` may carry the wallet backend's activity id when the backend accepted the send
  without a readable status id, and the activity-log history lists Solana sends under both of the
  backend's send activity types. See [TURNKEY_SUPPORT.md](docs/TURNKEY_SUPPORT.md#solana-notes).

## [5.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-09-30

First public beta, published to Maven Central under `xyz.rain`. Pin the exact version during the
beta; see [Compatibility](README.md#compatibility).

### Added

- `xyz.rain:rain-core-android`, `rain-portal-android`, `rain-privy-android`, `rain-turnkey-android`
  and `rain-wallet-android`, all at `5.0.0-beta.1`. `rain-wallet-android` embeds Rain's production
  wallet backend, so every account it creates is a production account, in a test build too.
- `@ExperimentalRainApi`. Implementing `WalletProvider`, `ProviderDescriptor` or `RainClient`
  requires opting in to it, because Rain may add members to these interfaces in any release.

### Known issues

Rain plans to fix each of these in a later beta.

- Solana sends through the Turnkey provider and the Rain wallet fail with `RAIN_501`
  (`ProviderError`), and nothing reaches the chain. The wallet backend rejects the request with
  HTTP 400. This affects `sendNative`, `sendToken` and `withdrawCollateral` on Solana chains. EVM
  sends, Solana reads, `prepareWithdrawal` and Privy's Solana sends are not affected. The fix is
  listed under Unreleased above.
- With Privy, a send the chain refuses for a shortfall of the native currency can arrive with the
  wrong code: an EVM send over the balance as `RAIN_502` (`InternalError`, "EVM error:
  OutOfFunds") and a Solana send from a wallet holding no SOL as `RAIN_501` (`ProviderError`).
  Both mean `RAIN_402` (`InsufficientFunds`). A Solana send from a wallet holding some SOL but less
  than the amount plus the fee also arrives as `RAIN_501`, and stays so after the fix. An app that
  retries on `RAIN_501` or `RAIN_502` resends a transfer that cannot succeed. The fix is listed
  under Unreleased above.
- The Rain wallet's contact attach, `sendContactVerificationCode` followed by
  `confirmContactVerification`, replaces the account's email address or phone number instead of
  adding a second one. The old contact then no longer logs in to the account. The attach also
  succeeds for an email address that already logs in to another account. That address keeps
  opening the other account, which leaves the signed-in account with no working email login.
  Tell users that an attach replaces their current contact.
- `getTokenBalances` and `getAllBalances` can leave out a token the wallet holds. On Ethereum, Base,
  Polygon and their test networks, the Turnkey provider and the Rain wallet build the list from the
  wallet backend's balance service. On other EVM chains, and with Privy on every EVM chain, the
  list holds only the SDK's built-in tokens and those passed to `registerTokens`. Portal builds it
  from Portal's own service. On Solana, the Turnkey provider and the Rain wallet ask the wallet
  backend first and read the node when it fails or lists no tokens, and Privy reads the node, which
  lists every token the wallet holds. On Base Sepolia, for example, the Rain wallet leaves out
  Rain USD.
  `getBalance(chainId, Token.Contract(address))` reads a single token from the chain and works
  for any token.
- At launch with a saved session, `RainProvider.authState` and `sessionState`, and
  `TurnkeyProvider.sessionState`, can emit `Unauthenticated` for a few milliseconds between
  `Loading` and the live session. An app that opens its login screen on that `Unauthenticated`
  shows it to a user who is still signed in.
