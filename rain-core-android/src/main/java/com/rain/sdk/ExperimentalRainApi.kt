/**
 * Marks Rain SDK API that may still change in a minor release.
 *
 * Through [SubclassOptInRequired] on an interface, the marker guards implementing it: a host that
 * writes its own [com.rain.sdk.provider.WalletProvider] or
 * [com.rain.sdk.provider.ProviderDescriptor] adds `@OptIn(ExperimentalRainApi::class)` to that
 * class and accepts that Rain may add members to the interface in any release, with a default body
 * wherever one makes sense. Calling the SDK through these interfaces needs no opt-in.
 *
 * On any other declaration, the marker means that declaration may change or be removed in any
 * release. The CHANGELOG records each such change.
