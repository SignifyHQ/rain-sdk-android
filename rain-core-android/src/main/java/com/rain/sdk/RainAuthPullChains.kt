/**
 * The chains Rain's Auth Pull runs on, grouped by environment.
 *
 * Rain's operator address and USDC contract both differ between sandbox and production, and the
 * two sets of chains do not overlap. Approving on a chain from the wrong environment therefore
 * produces a perfectly valid allowance that no authorization will ever draw on, and on a mainnet
 * chain it spends real gas to grant a real spend allowance to an address Rain does not use there.
 * The approval path rejects that pairing up front (see `RainSdkManager`).
 *
 * These sets answer for an *environment*. What a built SDK will actually accept is narrower: the
 * host's [RainAuthPullConfig] intersected with the chains that have an RPC endpoint, exposed as
 * `RainSdk.authPullChainIds` / `RainClient.authPullChainIds`. Gate UI on those; reach for
 * [SANDBOX] / [PRODUCTION] only before an SDK exists, and never keep a third copy of the list,
 * which is how these drift.
 *
 * Maintenance: in-tree like `TokenRegistry`, so the SDK owns updates. Rain is actively adding
 * chains to the beta; edit this file and ship a release. The matching USDC entries live in
 * `TokenRegistry`, and `RainAuthPullChainsTest` enforces that every chain here has one.
