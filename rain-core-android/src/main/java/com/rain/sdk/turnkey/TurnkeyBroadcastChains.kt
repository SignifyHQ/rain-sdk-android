/**
 * The chains Turnkey's managed transaction path can broadcast (and gas-sponsor) on.
 *
 * The Rain SDK's only send path on Turnkey is `ethSendTransaction` / `solSendTransaction`,
 * which exist solely on Turnkey's managed-broadcast networks — there is no self-broadcast
 * fallback (v0 decision). A send on any other chain would fail opaquely deep in the vendor
 * call, so [requireSendSupport] refuses it up front with [RainError.ChainNotSupported].
 *
 * Reads (balances, history, fee estimation) are deliberately NOT gated here; they need an RPC
 * endpoint registered for the chain (some balances also come from Turnkey's own indexer).
 * Avalanche, for example, is read-only but fully readable.
 *
 * Source of truth: Turnkey's transaction-management broadcasting documentation
 * (https://docs.turnkey.com/features/transaction-management). When Turnkey adds a network,
 * extend this list and mirror the change in rain-sdk-ios.
 *
 * This list is the VENDOR's capability, not Rain's product offering — those are different
 * questions. Rain's supported chains and tokens live at
 * https://docs.rain.xyz (Supported Chains and Tokens); a send actually works only for chains
 * in BOTH lists that also have an RPC endpoint registered. Rain chains outside this list
 * (Avalanche, Celo, ZKsync, Plasma, Ink) are read-only through this provider in v0; Stellar is
 * outside the SDK entirely.
